## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required for email functionality
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_FROM="WMX Services <noreply@wmx-services.dev>"

# Optional for cron job security
CRON_SECRET=your_cron_secret

# App URL for email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Resend Configuration
The system uses Resend as the email service provider:
- API Key required in `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Domain verification needed for custom domain
- Templates are React components with inline styles

## 📋 API Endpoints

### Testing Endpoints
```bash
# Test all email types
GET /api/test/email-system?test=all&to=test@example.com

# Test specific email type
GET /api/test/email-system?test=welcome&to=test@example.com

# Available tests: welcome, verification, invoice-reminder, project-status, 
# chat-notification, payment-confirmation, queue-status, process-queue, all
```

### Cron Job Endpoints
```bash
# Process email queue (run every 5 minutes)
GET /api/cron/process-email-queue

# Process invoice reminders (run daily)
GET /api/cron/invoice-reminders
```

## 🎯 Queue System

The email system includes a sophisticated queue system:

```typescript
// Queue an email for later processing
queueEmail({
  type: 'welcome',
  priority: 'high', // 'high' | 'normal' | 'low'
  data: {
    to: 'user@example.com',
    userName: 'John Doe',
    userRole: 'CLIENT'
  }
});

// Process the queue (called by cron job)
const result = await processEmailQueue();
```

### Queue Priority
- **High**: Authentication, payment confirmations
- **Normal**: Project updates, general notifications  
- **Low**: Marketing, non-urgent messages

## 📊 Email Flow Examples

### 1. User Signup Flow
```
User Signs Up
    ↓
Verification Code Email (Immediate)

```

### 2. Payment Flow
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Email Logs
All emails are logged in the `emailLog` table:
- User ID and project ID (if applicable)
- Email type and recipient
- Status (SENT/FAILED)  
- Timestamp

### Debug Information
- Queue status available via `/api/test/email-system?test=queue-status`
- Email templates render to HTML for debugging
- Console logs for queue processing results
- Error logging for failed email attempts

## 📈 Performance & Scalability

### Current Capacity
- Queue-based processing prevents API timeouts
- Priority system ensures important emails are sent first
- Cron jobs run every 5 minutes for timely delivery
- Batch processing for invoice reminders

### Scaling Recommendations
- For high volume: Consider dedicated email service worker
- For multiple domains: Add domain-specific email routing
- For analytics: Add email tracking and open rates
- For templates: Consider email template builder UI

## 🛡️ Security Features

- Cron job endpoints protected with secret token
- Email addresses validated before sending
- No sensitive data in email templates
- Error messages sanitized for production
- Rate limiting via queue system

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify email domain with Resend
- [ ] Set up Vercel cron jobs or external cron service

## 📝 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor email delivery rates

### Troubleshooting
1. **Emails not sending**: Check `EMAIL_ENABLED` and API key
